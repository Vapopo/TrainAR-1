# Object Helper Node

As specified in the [TrainAR Objects](TrainArObjects.html) documentation, TrainAR Objects have states and behaviours. The Object Helper nodeprovides various options to access and modify these from within the TrainAR Stateflow at runtime of the TrainAR training. In the **Helper** dropwodn menu you can select from the different options. To specifiy which **TrainAR Object** in the scene you want to modify, specify the exact **Object name** in the node.

## Toggle Visibility

Check or uncheck the **Visible** field to make the specified **TrainAR Object** visible or invisible.

## Toggle Grabbable

Check or uncheck the **Grabbable** field to make the specified **TrainAR Object** grabbable or not grabbable.

## Toggle Interactable

Check or uncheck the **Interactable** field to make the specified **TrainAR Object** interactable or not interactable.

## Toggle Combinable

Check or uncheck the **Combinable** field to make the specified **TrainAR Object** combinable or not combinable.

## Change Interaction text

Changes the labeling of the interaction button when selecting an TrainAR Object. A TrainAR Object is selected when you aim at a TrainAR Object and move close to it.

By default the labeling is simply *Interact* for every TrainAR Object.

## Change Lerping distance

This changes the distance with which a **grabbed TrainAR Object** floats away from the screen. Generally, you probably want to have bigger TrainAR Objects float at a larger distance than smaller ones. That way, they don't cover the whole screen while grabbing them.

## Change Mesh and Texture

With this option, you can change what a **TrainAR Object** looks like by changing it's mesh and/or material. This is for example useful if as a result of a combination or interaction an object is supposed to be altered.

## Get Object Reference

This node returns the **Unity GameObject** Reference of the specified **TrainAR Object**. For more information about Unity GameObjects, refer to the [Unity Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.html). This is mainly useful if you want to utilize Unitys Visual Scripting nodes in the Stateflow as specified in the [Advanced Options](https://jblattgerste.github.io/TrainAR/manual/NoVisualScripting.html#unity-visual-scripting-nodes).

## Fuse Two Objects

This attaches one **TrainAR Object** to another, making them one. The **Object name** field specifies the object that is fused onto the object, which is specified in the **Fuse to Object** field. In the **Offset Position and Rotation** field the position and rotation relative to the fused with TrainAR Object is specified.

## Destroy Object

Destroys and removes the specified TrainAR Object from the scene. 

## Replace TrainAR Object
Replaces a to be **replaced TrainAR Object** with another **replacing TrainAR Object**. The replaced **TrainAR Object** is set to invisible. The **replacing TrainAR Object** is also placed at the same position as the **replaced TrainAR Object**.

In case the **replaced TrainAR Object** is **grabbed** during replacement, the **replacing TrainAR Object** is also **grabbed**.
